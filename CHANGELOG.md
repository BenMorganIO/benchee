# 0.5.0 (October 13, 2016)

This release focuses on scaling units to more appropriate sizes. Instead of always working with base one for counts and microseconds those values are scaled accordingly to thousands, milliseconds for better readability. This work was mostly done by new contributor @wasnotrice.

## Features (User Facing)

* Console output now scales units to be more friendly. Examples:
    * instead of "44556677" ips, you would see "44.56 M"
    * instead of "44556.77 Î¼s" run time, you would see "44.56 ms"
* Console output for standard deviation omits the parentheses
* Scaling of console output can be configured with the 4 different strategies `:best`, `:largest`, `:smallest` and `:none`. Refer to the documentation for their different properties.
* Shortened the fast function warning and instead [linked to the wiki](https://github.com/PragTob/benchee/wiki/Benchee-Warnings#fast-execution-warning)

## Features (Plugins)

* The statistics module now computes the `minimum`, `maximum` and `sample_size` (not yet shown in the console formatter)
* you can rely on `Benchee.Conversion.Duration`, `Benchee.Conversion.Count` and `Benchee.Conversion.DeviationPercent` for help with formatting and scaling units

## Breaking Changes (Plugins)

* The `Benchee.Time`module is gone, if you relied on it for one reason or another it's succeeded by the more powerful `Benchee.Conversion.Duration`

# 0.4.0 (September 11, 2016)

Focuses on making what benchee print out configurable to make it fit to your preferences :)

## Features (User Facing)
* The configuration now has a `:print` key where it is possible to configure in a map what benchee prints out during benchmarking. All options are enabled by default (true). Options are:
  * `:benchmarking`  - print when Benchee starts benchmarking a new job (Benchmarking name ..)
  * `:configuration` - a summary of configured benchmarking options including estimated total run time is printed before benchmarking starts
  * `:fast_warning` - warnings are displayed if functions are executed too    fast leading to inaccurate measures
* There is also a new configuration option for the built-in console formatter. Which is also enabled by default:
  * `:comparison` - if the comparison of the different benchmarking jobs (x times slower than) is shown
* The pre-benchmarking output of the configuration now also prints the currently used Erlang and Elixir versions (similar to `elixir -v`)
* Add a space between the benchmarked time and the unit (microseconds)

# 0.3.0 (July 11, 2016)

This release switches internal data structures from lists of tuples to maps, allows the configuration of formatters, aggregates all values and hands them down so formatters can access the whole configuration, prints general configuration information and much more great stuff :)

## Breaking Changes (User Facing)
* The recommended data structure handed to `Benchee.run` was changed from a list of 2-element tuples to a map (`"Name" => benchmark_function`). However, **the old list of tuples still works but may be removed in future releases** (so it's not "breaking" _strictly_ speaking).
* You **can not have benchmark jobs with the same names anymore**, the last one wins here. This was the reason why previously the data structure was a list of tuples. However, having benchmarks with the same name is nonsensical as you can't discern their results in the output any way.

## Breaking Changes (Plugins)
* main data structure to hold benchmarks and results was changed from a list of 2-element tuples to a map (`"Name" => values`). That is for the jobs, the run times as well as the statistics. However, if you used something like `Enum.each(data, fn({name, value}) -> .. end)` you are still fine though, cause Elixir is awesome :)

## Features (User Facing)
* now takes a `parallel: number` configuration option and will then execute each job in parallel in as many parallel processes as specified in `number`. This way you can gather more samples in the same time and also simulate a system more under load. This is tricky, however. One of the use cases is also stress testing a system. Thanks @ldr
* the name column width is now determined based on the longest name. Thanks @alvinlindstam
* Print general configuration information at the start of the benchmark, including warmup, time, parallel and an estimated total run time
* New method `Benchee.Formatters.Console.output/1` that immediately prints to the console
* now takes a `formatters: [&My.Format.function/1, &Benchee.Formatters.console.output/1]` configuration option with which multiple formatters for the same benchmarking run can be configured when using `Benchee.run/2`. E.g. you can print results to the console and create a csv from that same run. Defaults to the builtin Console formatter.

## Features (Plugins)
* All previous configuration options are preserved after `Benchee.Statistics.statistics/1`, meaning there is access to raw run times as well as custom options etc. E.g. you could grab custom options like `%{csv: %{file: "my_file_name.csv"}}` to use.

## Bugfixes
* name columns are no longer truncated after 30 characters. Thanks @alvinlindstam

# 0.2.0 (June 11, 2016)

This release introduces warmup for benchmarks, nicer console output and the new `Benchee.measure` that runs the benchmarks previously defined instead of running them instantly.

## Breaking Changes (User Facing)
* `Benchee.benchmark/3` now doesn't run the benchmark anymore but simply adds it to `:jobs` in the config. The whole benchmark suite is then run via `Benchee.measure/1`. This only affects you if you used the more verbose way of defining benchmarks, `Benchee.run/2` still work as before.

## Breaking Changes (Plugins)
* the defined benchmarking are now preserved after running the benchmark under the `:jobs` key of the suite. Run times are added to the `:run_times` key of the suite (important for alternative statistics implementations)

## Features (User Facing)

* configuring a warmup time to run functions before measurements are taken can be configured via the `warmup` key in the config defaulting to 2 (seconds)

* statistics in console output are aligned right now for better comparisons
* last blank line of console output removed

## Features (Plugins)
* additionally supply the total standard deviation of iterations per second as `std_dev_ips` after `Benchee.Statistics.statistics`

## Bugfixes

* if no time/warmup is specified the function won't be called at all
